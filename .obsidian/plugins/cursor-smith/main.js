// ===========================================================================
// Cursor-Smith — READ THIS BEFORE EDITING
//
// ~9.8k lines in one file because Obsidian loads a single main.js and there
// is no build step. It is navigated by grep, not by scrolling. See
// ARCHITECTURE.md for the full tour; this header is the short version plus
// the rules that are expensive to rediscover.
//
// LAYOUT, in order:
//   1. Tuning constants        (DIRTY_RECT_CLEAR … FIREWORK_*, THUNDER_*)
//   2. DEFAULT_SETTINGS        — 116 keys, the single source of truth
//   3. LOOK_KEYS / VIM_STATE_KEYS
//   4. migrateLegacyKeys       — renamed/regrouped keys, runs on ALL loads
//   5. Built-in presets        (PRESET1_VIM_MODES, DEFAULT_PRESETS, …)
//   6. Share-code codec        (presetToCode / codeToPreset, "1|…" and "2|…")
//   7. Pure helpers            (colour maths, easing, geometry)
//   8. class CursorSmithPlugin — lifecycle, input, engine, every effect
//   9. class CursorSmithSettingTab — the panel
//
// FINDING THINGS: grep the symbol. Effects follow a strict naming convention,
// so `grep -n "Fireworks\|Thunderbolt" main.js` finds every touchpoint of one
// effect: spawnX / drawX, a gate in commitMove, a pool reset in three places,
// an entry in the frame governor's `animating` check, and a settings block.
//
// INVARIANTS — breaking these fails silently, not loudly:
//
//  • LOOK_KEYS IS APPEND-ONLY. Share codes encode a field as its INDEX in
//    this array. Reordering or removing an entry silently reinterprets every
//    code ever shared. Add to the end; never insert.
//
//  • ADDING AN EFFECT MEANS FIVE EDITS, not two. spawn + draw are the obvious
//    ones. Also: reset the pool in _resetEngineState (ONE place now - it used
//    to be three hand-copied lists, and they had already drifted apart), add
//    it to _isAnimating or it will freeze mid-animation, call its draw from
//    draw(), and _markDirty its region or it leaves ghosts.
//
//  • GENERATE AT SPAWN, ADVANCE CLOSED-FORM AT DRAW. Every effect bakes its
//    randomness once and animates as a pure function of elapsed time. Rolling
//    per frame makes the effect boil, and ties its shape to whichever gear
//    the frame governor picked.
//
//  • NO CSS ANIMATIONS on cursor layers, in styles.css or injectStyles. They
//    run on the compositor, outside the frame governor, and hold the display
//    at full refresh regardless of what the governor decided. Anything that
//    must pulse is written as a custom property from a tick instead - the
//    torch's blink pulse and its candle flicker are both done that way.
//
//  • ANYTHING PUT INTO A DOCUMENT MUST COME BACK OUT in unregisterDocument -
//    listeners, body classes, and the injected stylesheet. Obsidian updates a
//    plugin by unloading and reloading it WITHOUT a window reload, so anything
//    left behind outlives the version that created it.
//
//  • A BLEND INSIDE THE CURSOR WRAPPER composites against the wrapper, not the
//    editor - the wrapper is a stacking context. Anything that must blend with
//    the editor needs its own sibling layer under .app-container. See
//    ARCHITECTURE.md, "Blending against the editor".
//
//  • TORCH OVERLAY CSS LIVES HERE ONLY (injectStyles), never in styles.css —
//    its values are settings-driven custom properties, and a styles.css rule
//    outranked them once already. Same for mix-blend-mode on the canvas
//    wrapper: see applyCanvasBlend.
//
//  • THE CANVAS IS CLIPPED, NOT Z-INDEXED, to the editor pane (editorClip).
//    A full-viewport layer over the titlebar breaks Electron window dragging
//    even when invisible.
//
//  • SETTINGS READS GO THROUGH this.settings, which is SWAPPED per Vim mode
//    during the tick. Don't cache values across frames; use styleFor(key).
//
// TESTS: `node test.js` runs the whole file outside Obsidian with the Obsidian
// API stubbed (harness.js), plus a settings-panel render harness
// (panel_harness.js). 228 assertions covering migration, share codes, colour
// precedence, effect physics, the frame governor's gear decision, the engine
// state reset, and which rows the panel actually builds.
//
//  • A settings row that throws while being built removes ITSELF AND EVERY ROW
//    AFTER IT from the panel, silently. renderLookSettings has no `plugin`
//    binding - only `this.plugin` - and reads settings through `get`, never
//    this.plugin.settings, because it also renders the per-Vim-mode panels.
//    Add a panel assertion for any new row.

// Fraction of the heat range the custom ramp spends easing out of the cursor's
// own colour and into stage 1.
//
// Without it, stage 1 IS the resting colour, so a custom ramp replaced the

// seconds of silence, so most of the time you saw stage 1 and not the colour you
// picked. Reported as "it paints the cursor with the first of the four colours",
// and it is the same complaint as the cold-end damping in the built-in curve:
// Speed Demon is supposed to add heat on top of your cursor, not take the colour
// away and hand it back as a reward for typing.
//
// A hard `heat === 0 ? base : ramp` would snap on the first keystroke, so the

// The repeat column is the part with history. Autorepeat used to be allowed

// the fast way to delete: every repeat removes a real character, exactly the
// argument that got navigation its exemption. Dropping those repeats produced
// a platform split that shipped as a bug report: on desktop a held Backspace
// autorepeats through keydown with e.repeat set, so only the first press ever
// counted and the heat colour drained away mid-deletion - while on mobile
// there is no keydown autorepeat at all (each deletion is its own beforeinput
// event, no repeat flag), so the same gesture heated up fine. The platform
// where the guard was written is the one where it misfired.
//
// Weights: a held delete is real editing arriving at machine rate rather than
// finger rate, so it takes the same kind of discount navigation's autorepeat
// does (0.45/0.7 of the hand-pressed rate) off its full press weight of 1.

// look keys. Handing one over produced a code with an empty body - every Vim
// preset encoded to "1|<name>|", carrying nothing but its name, and importing
// one silently rebuilt the built-in starter looks (cloneVimModes falls back to
// VIM_MODE_STARTERS for any mode the snapshot doesn't describe, and it didn't
// describe any of them). That's what this format exists to fix.

// says "this mode is exactly the defaults", missing (a shorter code, e.g. one

    // flags, so "Cycle preset" keeps functioning with the custom cursors off.
    //
    // "Cycle preset" is one command that dispatches on the current mode
    // (CUA presets in CUA mode, Vim presets in Vim mode) under a single
    // stable ID, so one hotkey works in both modes.
    //
    // "Toggle CUA/Vim mode" was removed from the palette once, and is back.
    // Worth knowing why it left, because the reasons were real and none of
    // them was "we changed our minds": firing setVimModeEnabled from an
    // arbitrary app state ran a side-effect chain — flipping Obsidian's vim
    // keybindings via updateOptions(), which rebuilds every editor's
    // extensions, plus the synthetic-Escape normal-mode forcing — with no
    // idea whether there was an editor to run it against, and a failure
    // anywhere in it could lose the mode change itself.
    //
    // What changed is that every step of that chain now defends itself, and
    // none of that hardening was done for this command's sake:
    //
    //   • setVimModeEnabled PERSISTS the mode before any side effect runs, so
    //     nothing downstream can lose the switch.
    //   • Obsidian's vim keybindings are driven level-triggered and
    //     symmetrically, so there is no captured "previous state" left to be
    //     poisoned by a crash mid-switch.
    //   • forceVimNormalMode is single-flight, retries only until the vim
    //     adapter shows up (~1s) rather than spinning, bails outright if the
    //     mode flipped back underneath it, and is cancelled on unload.
    //
    // The one hazard the palette adds that the settings panel does not is
    // REPEAT: a held hotkey re-fires as fast as the OS repeats it, where a
    // segmented button cannot be clicked again mid-flight. toggleUiMode() is
    // single-flighted for exactly that, and is the only thing here that
    // exists because of the palette.

         that is why the warning below exists rather than the feature.

         A CSS animation is driven by the compositor, entirely outside the rAF
         frame governor - so it pinned the display to full refresh rate forever
         whenever the torch was on, no matter what gear the render loops chose.
         The overlay is also the worst possible element to animate that way: it
         carries mix-blend-mode: multiply over the whole editor pane, so every
         flicker frame forced the blended layer to be recomposited against its
         backdrop rather than being a cheap compositor-only opacity change.

         So: do NOT re-add an animation or transition property on
         .torch-cursor-overlay for the flame, here or in styles.css - the
         effect you would be reaching for already exists, one governor-friendly
         custom-property write per frame, quantised so most frames skip it. */

  // or the energy shimmer): a full-surface clear plus a full-surface composite
  // 30-60 times a second, to change a caret-sized region.
  //
  // So each primitive reports the box it painted and the next frame clears
  // exactly the union of what the last one touched. Nothing is predicted in
  // advance, so this cannot drift out of sync with the drawing code - but a
  // primitive that paints WITHOUT calling _markDirty will leave ghost pixels
  // behind. If you add an effect, mark its bounds, generously: over-reporting
  // only costs fill rate, under-reporting corrupts the frame.
